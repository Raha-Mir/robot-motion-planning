# Robot-Motion-Planning-and-Control
This is a brief university repository for Robot Motion Planning and Control using RoboToolbox and Python 3.8.10:

### ðŸ§© Quintic Polynomial Trajectory
- This code provides a basic implementation of the algorithm for finding the coefficients of a time-based trajectory.

---
### ðŸ§© Path Planning
This lab work is brief and requires:
- Write a program to plan a path from an initial point to a final point while avoiding obstacles using the **Potential Field Method**
- Independently define the initial and final positions, as well as obstacle locations in the workspace
- Visualize the resulting path and obstacle avoidance behavior

### ðŸ§© Trajectory Planning Through Multiple Points
This lab work is brief and requires:
- Write a program to generate a motion trajectory for a selected manipulator that passes through **four predefined points**
  - 4.1 Select a robot model  
  - 4.2 Solve the **forward** and **inverse kinematics**  
  - 4.3 Define four target points for the robot to pass through  
  - 4.4 Choose appropriate **time functions** for motion  
  - 4.5 Compute the function parameters for smooth trajectory planning  
- Visualize the final trajectory and robot motion
