# Robot-Motion-Planning
This is a brief university Lab-work for Robot Motion Planning using Python 3.8.10:

### ðŸ§© Quintic Polynomial Trajectory
- This code provides a basic implementation of the algorithm for finding the coefficients of a time-based trajectory.

---
### ðŸ§­ Path Planning
 It is a short Lab work that:
- Write a program to plan a path from an initial point to a final point while avoiding obstacles using the **Potential Field Method**
- Independently define the initial and final positions, as well as obstacle locations in the workspace
- Visualize the resulting path and obstacle avoidance behavior
